                    <p class="card-text">The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa
                        and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy
                        tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females
                        and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride
                        consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt
                        together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although
                        some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically
                        do not actively seek out and prey on humans.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Elephants are the largest existing land animals. Three living species are
                        currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian
                        elephant. They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order
                        Proboscidea; extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons. Distinctive features of elephants
                        include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but
                        sensitive grey skin. The trunk is prehensile, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping
                        objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for
                        moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body
                        temperature as well as in communication. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs,
                        whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Zebras (US: /ˈziːbrəz/, UK: /ˈzɛbrəz, ˈziː-/)[1] (subgenus Hippotigris) are
                        African equines with distinctive black-and-white striped coats. There are three living species:
                        the Grévy's zebra (Equus grevyi), plains zebra (E. quagga), and the mountain zebra (E. zebra).
                        Zebras share the genus Equus with horses and asses, the three groups being the only living
                        members of the family Equidae. Zebra stripes come in different patterns, unique to each
                        individual. Several theories have been proposed for the function of these stripes, with most
                        evidence supporting them as a deterrent for biting flies. Zebras inhabit eastern and southern
                        Africa and can be found in a variety of habitats such as savannahs, grasslands, woodlands,
                        shrublands, and mountainous areas.</p>

                    <p class="card-text" style="color: black;">Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds from the order Sphenisciformes
                        (/sfɪˈnɪsəfɔːrmiːz/) of the family Spheniscidae (/sfɪˈnɪsɪdiː, -daɪ/).[4] They live almost
                        exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere: only one species, the Galápagos penguin, is found north
                        of the Equator. Highly adapted for life in the ocean water, penguins have countershaded dark and
                        white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other
                        forms of sea life which they catch with their bills and swallow whole while swimming. A penguin
                        has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey.[5]</p>
